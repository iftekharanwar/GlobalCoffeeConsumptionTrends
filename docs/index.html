            <h2>Correlation Analysis: Production and Climate Variables</h2>
            <p>Our analysis revealed the following correlations:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Correlation between Production and Temperature: 0.16 (p-value: 0.6111)</li>
                <li>Correlation between Production and Precipitation: 0.05 (p-value: 0.8686)</li>
            </ul>
            <p>These results suggest weak positive correlations between coffee production and both temperature and precipitation. However, the high p-values indicate that these correlations are not statistically significant.</p>

            <h2>Actionable Recommendations</h2>
            <h3>For Coffee Producers:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Diversify coffee varieties: Given the weak correlation between climate variables and production, explore climate-resilient coffee varieties.</li>
                <li>Implement sustainable practices: Adopt circular economy principles and organic farming methods to improve long-term sustainability.</li>
                <li>Monitor climate patterns: Regularly assess local climate trends to adapt cultivation practices accordingly.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>For Policymakers:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Support research: Invest in studies on climate-resistant coffee varieties and sustainable farming practices.</li>
                <li>Develop incentives: Create programs to encourage adoption of sustainable and climate-smart coffee production methods.</li>
                <li>Promote international cooperation: Facilitate knowledge sharing between coffee-producing countries to address common challenges.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>For Consumers:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Choose sustainable brands: Support coffee producers and brands that prioritize environmentally friendly practices.</li>
                <li>Reduce waste: Opt for reusable coffee filters and cups to minimize environmental impact.</li>
                <li>Stay informed: Learn about the origins of your coffee and the challenges faced by producing regions.</li>
            </ul>
